    "description": "This chair is made with premium Italian leather, although it may feel rock hard the leather is on the inside. This special chair can only be found in one room through out all of Monte Vista. Only in room 802 where the game designers come and gather, enhanced with a lever which is on the bottom and can be used to adjust the size, truly a great innovation.  ",
