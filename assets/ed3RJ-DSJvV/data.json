    "description": "#MASTERCOPY of Bolivian Artist Mamani Mamani's Pachamama painting \n\nSome behind-the-scenes notes:\n• I created the behind part of this painting out of the designs and characters that exist in the painting, see all around!\n\n• I met this amazing Bolivian artist, plus did some research and had an interview about his thoughts in life prior to the VR painting to get a better sense of how Mamani Mamani thinks of his art to try to imagine how he might have painted this in VR.\n\n• Mamani Mamani uses a lot of details in his art because of the deep understanding he has of Bolivian culture. \n\n• To create his very recognizable fading of colors through the piece I used a mix of more than 3 brushed and took a LOT of time and effort, but the results are remarkable!\n\n• I loved using so many colors and brushes, also taking the time to imagine the painting as an sculpture. \n\nHope you like it!
