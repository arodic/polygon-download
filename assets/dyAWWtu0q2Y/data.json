    "description": "Who's gonna win?? Left Swan or Right Swan. \n\nLeft Swan looks locked in and determined to win. We all remember what happened last time. \n\nRight Swan has been waiting for this day for weeks. Practicing in mirrors and glass windows, looks ready to go. \n\nYou couldn't cut this tension with a knife. These swans give everything,  as they always do, to try and win. ",
