    "description": "Meet Redips, Jelly Skull, Rocky the Rock Blob and... George.\n\nThese strange anomalies from another dimension were designed by youngsters who attended the Hampton Portals workshop with artists Lee Mason and Korp from Hampton Peterborough, UK.\n\nThey will be added to a Unity based treasure hunt experience built in conjunction with Beta Jester and some will also be 3D printed as gifts for the participants.\n\nThere will be another wave of these manifesting in a second Hampton Portals workshop soon.
