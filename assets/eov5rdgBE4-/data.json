    "description": "This piece is black and white - that much is obvious. I thrive where there are few shades of grey. I thrive where light stands out from dark. Shapes is the concrete execution of the form of a series of sketches minus the substance. Where there was flesh, it’s been vaporized so that structure can stand out.\n\nWhile having a blank slate can be comforting, more often than not, it’s overwhelming. The universe in the long run will be pure blackness yet this is not maliciousness. It is what it is. I veered into a black canvas and acknowledged it as a blank canvas. Only then was I able to immerse myself in creating these structures.",
