    "description": "This sculpture, created in Google Blocks with an Oculus Rift, uses the organic shape of a spider web and a simple color scheme to represent the WebXR environments differently than virtual worlds as expressed in the Communities of Practice sculpture. \n\nThe spiderâ€™s web is an apt metaphor. It is a three-dimensional shape that is simple yet powerful, decentralized, and each one is unique. \nThe threads are silver, representing modernity and that which is man made, mechanical, and also technological. \nThe purple dewdrops represent individual virtual environments and people. Purple is a color long associated with creativity, nobility, and spirituality, so it is particularly appropriate for representing our highest and best purposes.\n\nThis sculpture was created for the Immersive Learning Research Conference 2020 in Frames, as part of the Community Virtual Library showcase. \n",
