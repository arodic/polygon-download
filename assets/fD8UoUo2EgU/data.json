    "description": "Next I sketch in some rough facial features. It's important to check everything you're drawing from  different angles to make sure the lines aren't too flat!\n\nTo help with readability I've used the wire brush to fill in the middle of the sketch .\n\nI've added some asymmetry in her pose too. I'll keep the mirror plane on for her face for the time being, but her body will be asymmetrical.",
