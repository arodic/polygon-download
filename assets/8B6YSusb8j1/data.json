    "description": "RES Thulium is a multi-component modular vital apparatus with an integral seed dispersion formula. The handheld burial accessories are diasporic activators for application and renewal. We have developed a workshop program which can be used in communities and education centers as part of our outreach initiative. Participants are able to interact with the various activation points on the object. The ergonomic capabilities of the burial accessories pertain to shifts in cognitive patterns which support our discourse-led incubator : divergent thinking for possible worlds.\n\nhttp://energypangea.org/",
