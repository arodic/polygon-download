    "description": "I am not a League player, but I don't know how many times I watched that Popstars video. \n\nBig props to Riot Games for the skins, and Fortiche Prod for giving them so much life! \n\nWhenever I see works like this, I wish I could animate :( I can't, so I drew in the air for about 30 hours instead. \n\nI probably won't be posting anything new for the rest of the year so happy holidays to you all <3 \n\nThank you for the support! \n\nPS: Apologies if I got some details wrong! \n---\n\nLeague of Legends/KDA belongs to Riot Games. \n\nhttps://jennifermori.carbonmade.com",
