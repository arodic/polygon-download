    "name": "Emblem of Sri Lanka",
    "description": "The national emblem of #SriLanka is used by the State of #SriLanka and the #SriLankan government in connection with the administration and government of the country. The current emblem has been in use since 1972.\n\nThe emblem features a gold lion passant, holding a sword in its right fore paw (the same lion from the flag of Sri Lanka) in the centre on a maroon background surrounded by golden petals of a Blue Lotus the national flower of the country. This is placed on top of a traditional grain vase that sprouts sheaves of rice grains that circle the border reflecting prosperity.\n\nThe crest is the #Dharmachakra, symbolizing the country's foremost place for #Buddhism and just rule. Traditional #Sinhalese heraldic symbols for the sun and the moon form the supporters. #Sun and #Moon, and #Lion depicting #LordBuddha is given less prominence than cart wheel of English Buddhism, so it is in great discordance with National Scriptures.",
