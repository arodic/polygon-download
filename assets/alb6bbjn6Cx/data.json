    "description": "Double charm event in CERN NA65/DsTau experiment. This is the real data from the experiment at CERN. A 400 GeV proton hit a tungsten nucleus and created a bunch of new particles, in which two of them express decay topology. They are short-lived \"charm particles\". The length of this event is 10 mm.\n",
