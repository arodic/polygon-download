    "description": "Art is all about the way we express ourselves and the world around us. For me personally, as someone whose life and interests have heavily revolved around science and computers, art bridges the gap between living and non-living, between man and machine. My interest in computer science stems from the idea that because you have control over what happens and what goes on in your program, what you can create is limitless. And yet, at the same time, there is a limit, because in many ways, computer science and art are intertwined, because even if you are given all the materials you could ever need to make anything, those materials will become useless without direction on how to build with them. In the same way, art in computer graphics is the way through which code, or the materials are channeled to create something truly beautiful. \nIn terms of my final project, 4.5 billion years ago, the earth was formed, and according to scientists and historians, it used to be covered with lava due to constant bombardment from meteors, but at the end of the day, this still is a theory, that no one has ever seen.\nMy retelling is a what if scenario in which instead of meteors colliding with the Earth, what if it were created by aliens, and the lava filled surface depicted in all the images and documentaries turned out to have been poured onto the surface by these aliens, who have been using Earth as their own dumping ground?\n\nThe goal of my project is to highlight the fact that while we constantly learn more and more about our universe, there is still much of that that is theoretical and hypothetical, and for all we know, it is something completely outside of our expectations.\n",
