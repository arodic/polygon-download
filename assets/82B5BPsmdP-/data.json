    "description": "In 1838 a woolen mill officially started production on 312 North Main Street, its name being Mishawaka Woolen Company-Ball Band Rubber.. In 1866 after the company grew from its humble 25 person starting crew Martin V. Beiger and Adolphus Eberhart created the all-knit boot, eliminating the need for the wool to be produced there, thus creating the signature shoe created from this company.The knit boot was made with a black band around the top. In 1891, the Red Ball was added to the band, and it was registered as a trademark in 1901. The Red Ball on the black band naturally suggested the name “BALL-BAND,” and this name was also registered in 1901. In 1906 the company officially dissolved and in 1997 the building was demolished.\n\n",
