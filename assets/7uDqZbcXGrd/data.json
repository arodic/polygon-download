    "description": "The word Merkaba is composed of three separate words: \n'Mer' =  light\n'Ka' = spirit\n'Ba' = body\nLIGHT-SPIRIT-BODY\nThe symbol, which takes the form of a six-pointed, three-dimensional star, composed of two-star tetrahedrons, is made entirely of light and is designed to transport or connect the spirit and body to higher realms. It is believed to generate counter-rotating fields of light and energy which every individual being is surrounded by. Even whole planets are believed to have this Merkaba energy field around them. \nFor my 3d mandala, I have intersected THREE flattened MERKABAS in keeping with the SACRED GEOMETRY of SIX.\nMagically, this produces SEVEN levels, one for each of the SEVEN CHAKRAS, each one represented by one of the SEVEN colours of the RAINBOW.",
