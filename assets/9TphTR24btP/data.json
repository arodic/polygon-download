    "description": "This painting is a healing experience from the LightForce Center meditation.  Delight for center is run by Alexander Mendeluk and Shayoon Mendeluk. This VR universe shows the process of engaging higher consciousness. I depict birds of power from indigenous cultures around the world. I showed the eye of Horus and the pineal gland of the brain as it opens, the third eye. The quantum opens to heal the earth with light. This is Purpose.\n",
