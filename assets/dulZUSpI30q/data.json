    "description": "Model by Juraj Kos\nThe culmination of many months of anatomy study, this is a representation of a female musculoskeletal structure that directly affects the outer shape of the body.\n\nHuge thanks to Ryan Kingslien for his expansive, in-depth anatomy course, especially the muscle sculpting parts. Also, a big thanks for making a similar model available with Zbrush, from which Iâ€™ve taken the skeleton for this project.",
