    "name": "Laloux Land",
    "description": "My first project, a fantasy environment with some very obvious Rene Laloux borrowing. It features three safe houses, three deities, an array of characters and lots if hidden details. Shove your head into any solid object, there is often something inside. This was drawn in the early days of Tiltbrush so I was unable to scale up to draw tiny things and I had to stand on a chair to draw the large monster. This was also as large an area as was possible at that time.",
