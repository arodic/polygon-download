    "description": "Based off the character design from the game \"Good Robot\" by Shamus Young, this robot is... certainly something to behold. Not sure if \"good\" is really appropriate. One of my finer character models, and featured in several animations, which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/user/peripheralarbor/search?query=good+robot\n\nLike this model, but need something a bit different? I take commissions! http://peripheralarbor.com/commission/",
