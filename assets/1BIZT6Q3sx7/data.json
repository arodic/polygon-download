    "description": "Exploring the concept of infinity through rings. Each ring holds 8 rings, which hold 8 more and so on. The large ring is part of another set of large rings, which is part of another set of larger rings, and so on. In this way, the sets of rings never end and never truly begin. This model depicts 5 iterations:\n1 - 1 ring\n2 - 8 rings\n3 - 64 rings\n4 - 512 rings\n5 - 4096 rings\nTotal 4681 rings",
