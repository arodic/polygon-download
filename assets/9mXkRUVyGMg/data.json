    "name": "TB EXP: Brushes File Load(1/2)",
    "description": "This experiment will show the file size and file load of each brush in Tilt Brush. This first part shows how I take an in depth look at and organized all the brushes according to observation and I group them all accordingly in a grid. This will help me identify some of the brush properties that are heaviest on the file load of my artwork, which can affect performance of the piece when it's open.\n\nThis sketch is open for remix. Please feel free to rearrange this grid if you see an alternative way to arrange these brushes. If you know how to organize the sfx brushes into sub-groups based on their actual make-up I would love to see! Thanks!\n\nWatch me make this on You Tube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPZljvp-eEhbvOcoQGIv5Cg?view_as=subscriber\n\n#TheSabbyLife",
