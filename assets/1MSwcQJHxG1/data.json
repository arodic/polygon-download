    "description": "I wanted to create the feeling of a cont√© drawing on toned paper. Starting with the portrait first, somewhere in the middle of the process I felt it would be fun, and a little bit cheeky, to make a larger scene in which the portrait evolved into an art model reading on her break. At about the halfway point of this piece Google released the 15th version of Tilt Brush with useful features like select/deselect and copy.",
