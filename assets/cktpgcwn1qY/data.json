    "description": "Following the departure of my dad 3 years ago, when he said that he needed to buy cigarettes, it is my duty to bring him back.  I vaguely remember him, he always yelled at himself and constantly played League of Legends.  One time he said, \"Get this SHIT off Me!!!\" as if the shirt was attacking him.  My dad attempted to abuse me but he went to the gym to make his muscles enormous.  He was short to around 5'6'', but he claimed to be 6'5\".  Anyway please come home dad...",
