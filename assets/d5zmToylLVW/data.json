    "description": "Microcosm and macrocosm, worlds within worlds, fractals, every molecule holds the universe.\nFrom a crystal forest, the roots run deep, just below the surface another world exists, and often there is more hidden beneath the earth, than we can imagine. These roots anchor us, and keep our higher selves grounded and real in the 3d world, while our souls are mirrored into infinity. We are part angel and part animal, a channel between the heavens and the earth, and are reflected in the stars.",
