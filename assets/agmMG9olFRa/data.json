    "description": "The Legend of Mayahuel is one about the source of agave which is the plant used to make tequila/mezcal. He basically saves her from her evil grandma and hide as a tree with two branches on Earth. The grandma finds them on Earth and strikes them with lightning, killing Mayahuel. The broken parts of the tree nourished by his tears cause agave to grow. It was all part of his plan to give man the plant that will help him throughout the hard journey on Earth. Would like to thank my patron, Tricia Crivello and my sponsor 1933 Spirits/ Mi Casa Tequila. Special shout out to DJ Pumpkin, RIP.",
