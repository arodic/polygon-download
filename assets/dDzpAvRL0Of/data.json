    "description": "This experience concentrates on the issue of ocean pollution and plastic  pollution which ultimately effects the health of marine wildlife and people. Just one plastic bottle indicates the disposability of everyday products washing into the ocean and river all over the world. The microplastics that occupy our oceans end up in animals and in the food that we eat. This experience is supposed to enlighten and push viewers to see how they c an change their choices to better the environment. \n\nVR Art created during S.O.Y.
