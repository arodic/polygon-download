    "name": "Consumer VR and Facebook Map",
    "description": "This map seeks to illustrate the tension in the VR industry between Facebook’s great success in the Oculus Rift and Quest headsets which have driven the technology forward by leaps and bounds, and their business practices and data policies which belie the company’s public commitments to act responsibility with data they collect. With this in mind, I hope that this map can help potential customers better understand how Facebook’s VR headsets differ from the rest of the market and allow people to make a more informed decision before purchasing a VR headset.\n\nThe size of the bubbles on the Map are relative to the hardware, platform, and controlling company's market share. Originally I included more headset options, but the information was too cluttered and lead to some confusion, so featured here are only the most popular options.\n\nSources-\n\"Data Policy\".
