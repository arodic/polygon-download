    "description": "i basicly created an abstract universe were some things are different depends on where you look from, for example in the upper world there is a sea, infinite loop of moving stars, a mountain where there is a giant plant with spikes and 2 flowers. while in the world bellow the mountain is a moon and the sea is the sky. aldough the moon could look like a lightbulb if you look closely. \n\nthis is my first Tilt Brush Scene and i'l probobly continue it in the future.",
