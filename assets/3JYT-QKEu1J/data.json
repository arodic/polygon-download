    "description": "Ludovico Mazzolino1524\n\nChrist is arguing with the Scribes and Pharisees. Mary and Joseph are approaching from the right, and from the left comes the donor Francesco Caprara in devout attitude. There are people listening on the loggia of the temple in the background. This is decorated on the parapet with monochrome relief scenes inspired by ancient sarcophaguses: on the left they show Judith with the head of Holofernes and the Jews' struggle against the Assyrians, and on the right Goliath struck by the stone from David's sling and the battle against the Philistines. On the rear wall of the temple are two gold reliefs: on the left, Moses with the tablets of the law, and on the right, prophesying the victory of the Jews.",
