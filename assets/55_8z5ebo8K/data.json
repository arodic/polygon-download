    "description": "#MastercopyMonday! I'll be learning by copying masters, evolving their paintings into VR. \n\nFor this NCWyeth, I followed his traditional painting techniques. It came out to a 2.5D style!\n\nSome lessons learned:\n- blending colors in VR is very manual and requires great control of values and color.\n- value grouping is king, as always.\n- it's nice to work in layers, to physically go back and forth between layers. But it's also okay to overlay the background colors on top of the foreground layers to clean up the edges.\n- it's still all about relationship between edges!\n\nI'd like to try 2.5D paintings with some focal points done in 3D depth. I did this with the rider's grip of the reins in this one.\n\nWatch the playback / process here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPrzGohocPk",
