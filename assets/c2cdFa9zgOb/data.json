    "description": "Virtual Cities started as an exhibition art piece with the aim of combining physical space with virtual reality. We assembled foam blocks within a room, mimicking an abstract simplified cityscape, which was then painted over in virtual reality using tilt brush. The result is a piece of art which attempts to transcend media.\nVisitors can put on the headset and navigate through the real space, but see an augmented version of the block layout.",
