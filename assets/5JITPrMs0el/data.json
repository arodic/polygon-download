    "description": "Near the village of Ludwikowice Kłodzkie in Silesia, Poland, there is a massive concrete decagon atop concrete pillars dozens of feet high. It was left behind by the Nazis, but no one knows what its function was.\n\nThe structure has no official name, but it is commonly known as Muchołapka, a nickname bestowed upon it by a Polish journalist. A muchołapka is a traditional Western European flytrap, a kind of glass decanter that lures insects to a watery death through a hole in its base. This name sums up the intrigue surrounding the unexplained structure.\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mucholapka",
