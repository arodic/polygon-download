    "description": "This is a model of a South indian temple. The model was made from scratch in blender , Without any reference but memories of the temple that i have seen at my ancestral home in south chittoor (Kerala). In  the centre which hosts the sanctum sanctorium, if you peek inside you can see a model of lor Ganesha, the lord of Beginning and remover of obstacles. Models are mostly low poly and not highly detailed.",
