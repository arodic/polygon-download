    "name": "Aquifer Model",
    "description": "All water in the ground is groundwater. As water percolates, or moves through, layers of substrate, it may reach an aquifer. An aquifer is a layer of permeable rock. \"Permeable\" means water can move through the substance, either around the material or through the material. Aquifers are deposits of water that occupy space in between rocks or even in porous (hole-y) rocks. These deposits of water have been important to humanity; much of farmland USA sits atop large aquifers. Wells and pumps are needed to access aquifers as they are deep within the ground, sometimes upwards of 30,000 feet. Explore the model to identify surface water, percolating water, groundwater, and ultimately an aquifer held in permeable rock.",
