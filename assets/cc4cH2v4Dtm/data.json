    "description": "Final Visual Arts Project for Jazz Music History. For this project, it was inspired by the Weather Report song \"Birdland\" I used the imagery it invoked in me to create what I personally imagine when I listen to the song \"Birdland\"\n\nI included some of the songs of the albums as \"rides\" in the amusement park such as \n\nThe Jaw Dropping Thrill Ride \"Palladium\" \nThe Ferris Wheel \"The Juggler\"\nand The Mysterious Tent \"Harlequin\"",
