    "description": "Consumerism has brought us anxiety (Pope Francis, 2014). And our solution is to medicate ourselves and bury the anxiety within us, until we ultimately succumb to our obsession for consumerism. Prescription medication is an object that unites these two worlds together, the happiness of our material wealth leads to our depression. We choose to medicate the problem that is a part of us. The inescapable reality that I have created shows this journey. My artwork shows how as a society, we rely on drugs to live and the only way for us to live is to feed into consumerism, which then sustains the culture. ",
