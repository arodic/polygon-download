    "description": "Inspired by Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away, I wanted to play with the brushes to sculpt out a dragon. The body and head was created using TOON as the outline with fillings by WIRE. The hair was made using OIL to give it form and FIRE brush to give it a magical effect. \n\nFollow me @swanvrart or swanvr.art",
