    "name": "Rat Hulk w/ Rashra's Eye",
    "description": "Your typical sewer overgrown, mutated rat hulk is a large enough threat, but one who has obtained Rashra's Ruby Eye possesses even more deadly abilities. \nName: Austin Glover\nEmail: austinglover92@gmail.com\nPiece: #2\nFeatures: This rat hulk wields a magical item, Rashra's Eye. The rat hulk has patchy fur that has been dyed by the sewage in its home, as well as protruding veins, sewage, and open (infected) wounds. The rat hulk is in an unlikely fight with a young boy who has unfortunately found his way into the sewer. A bullseye with that slingshot should neutralize the rat hulk..don't miss. ",
