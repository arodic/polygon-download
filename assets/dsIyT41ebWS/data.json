    "name": "Karla Dickens Second Skin",
    "description": "Born in 1967 in Sydney, Karla Dickens is an artist of Wiradjuri, Irish and German heritage. From her website, Dickens remarks upon her formative years as a 'double dawn for Aboriginal people' with the referendum that provided Aboriginal peoples with status. It was a time of self discovery which had a strong influence on her creative talents. Whilst embracing the notion of identity politics her works foster intra and cross cultural dialogue through the forum of contemporary art.\n\nKarla has participated in numerous solo and group exhibitions. Dickensâ€™ important group exhibitions include Defying Empire: 3rd National Indigenous Art Triennial at the National Gallery of Australia (2017); The National 2017: New Australian Art, Carriageworks, Sydney and Grounded: Contemporary Australian Art at the National Art School Gallery, Sydney (2017). Her work is held in major collections including the National Gallery of Australia; National Museum of Australia, Canberra; Australian National Maritime Museum, Sydney; and Artbank, Sydney. Karla is represented by Andrew Baker Art Dealer, Brisbane.",
