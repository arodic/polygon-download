    "description": "I used to love making gingerbread houses and imagining all sorts of stories about the gingerbread family that lived there. This holiday season, I wanted to try and bring that to life using tilt brush! Welcome to the cheeriest little gingerbread house situated at the North Pole. I highly recommend playing some holiday music while viewing this. If you're viewing it in poly, make sure your environment is set to the snowy scene! I didn't realize that when I upload it to poly, it wouldn't generate the environment as well. Enjoy and Happy Holidays!",
