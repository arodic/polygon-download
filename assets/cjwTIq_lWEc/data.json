    "description": "Heaven and Hell \n\nThis is my journey into salvation. The left side represents hell. The smoke symbolizes the thick fog in my life that was present without the Lord. The trees look nice, but in reality, the fog covers the natural beauty. Its as if the fog was covering up my true potential by being there and shrouding away from my potential and who I could be. Satan is represented by the snake, who is surrounded by fire. The fire symbolizes the hard times and the pain that is felt before you accept Jesus. Connecting the two worlds, is my life verse, Mark 8:36â€”What does it profit a man to gain the whole world, get lose his soul. On the other side, there is a big cross with a butterfly behind it. This symbolizes the Lord. Even though butterflies are small and sometimes unnoticeable, you really have to look and you need look closely to see them. The doves represent the purity that comes with following Christ. On the other side, you have myself. Finally, the stars represent the overall beauty of following Christ. ",
