    "description": "took us 3625434754 tries, but my space ship is finally all set. The laser texture, as well as the color for the thrust from the engines, didn't show, and the inside of the engine was colored, as they all had identical glowing properties that just don't work. This also goes for the Red Star, it had identical glowing material that doesn't work either. ",
