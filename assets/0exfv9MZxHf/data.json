    "description": "\ntiltbrush sketch I made with oculus.\nIt is inspired to a bay near lagadakia beach, in Cefalonia. Rocks were standing around this wonderful clean water, and you could see many little creatures swimming around.\nNo one was there. I tried to imitate the peacefulness of that place with tiltbrush vr , hope it communicates a bit of that summer atmosphere to you guys :)\nIf you want to follow me on instagram my account is https://www.instagram.com/emiliacomix/",
