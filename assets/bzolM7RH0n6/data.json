    "description": "The dancing devils of San Francisco de Yare are a a Venezuelan tradition going back to the 18th century. During the feast of Corpus Christi, dozens of dancers, wearing giant masks like this one, walk and shuffle together in a procession headed for the church of San Francisco de Yare. The festival takes place over a few days. The dancers sign on to perform as a rite of penance that culminates in their being \"defeated\" by the priest of the church.
