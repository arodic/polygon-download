    "description": "This is a scene I created in #VR using #TiltBrush for an event in the Perot Museum of Nature and Science in Dallas, USA. ( https://www.perotmuseum.org/ ) \nIt depicts my artistic impression of what goes on inside the human brain, with neurons passing signals through the synapses, streams of electricity jolting around, all in one giant, immersive environment.... \n\nFilmed using #3DRudder hardware. \n\nFeel free to contact me for any questions, work on commission or live performance: reinbijlsma@live.nl, and don't forget to subscribe to my YouiTube channel :-). \n",
