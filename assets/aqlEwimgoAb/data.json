    "description": "#galacticsafari\nKlaavalian Dune Larvae.\nDespite its gigantic size the Klaavalian Dune Larvae is only a baby, it stays in this form for over 100 earth years - living underground, growing larger, feeding off rock sediment and minerals before metamorphosis takes place. In some cases the Larvae have been found to have hollowed out entire moons, leaving nothing behind but asteroid fields and clouds of noxious methane gas drifting through space.",
