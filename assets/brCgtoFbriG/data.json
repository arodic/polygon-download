    "description": "Fatherhood was a piece of Street Art on the streets of Amsterdam... and is now destroyed. The artist (Stinkfish) decided to paint this artwork as a reminder for fathers to be more engaged with their children and was inspired by a picture he took at a bus stop in Nepal of a father carrying his child.\n\nThis is just one of the many monumental pieces of Street Art belonging to the collection of the Street Art Museum of Amsterdam.",
