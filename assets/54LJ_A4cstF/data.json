    "description": "Pan around to the sights of an alien biome teaming with fauna unlike those from home. The air is thick, and damp like water.. yet, suitably breathable. Though, you don't know how you got there, and the eels don't seem to like it when you get too close. However, they are the only things keeping you safe too.. for the time being..\n\nAdd your favorite - I recommend something peaceful or alien - music and enjoy the comfort of this strange alien biome.",
