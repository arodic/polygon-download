    "description": "Once an honorable Paladin of the Order she was ejected for being too reckless.\nThen a servant of a Queen killed by her own lust for power.\nDefeated and resurrected in a duel with a corrupted warrior.\nFinally possessed by the very entity that held thrall over her past queen.\n\nNow Eotha has set aside Good; it has failed her for too long. The only way to regain her throne is to embrace the darkness.",
