    "description": "This is the third piece in an experimental series, as a Tilt Brush in Quest novice, learning to use the app, Here I made a template of a geometric mandala design, using the cube shape, flattened and made enormous, so when human sized, one could walk around the sculpture. I used simple felt tip straight mirrored lines, for the basis, then copied the result twice, and intersected them to make a 3d mandala in space, adding glowing rainbow orbs with the FIRE OF THE SOUL in the centre. A sprinkling of glowing dots, and snowflakes reflect the six-sided geometry. \nThe piece looks best when seen full-size in a large space with a headset, as it is to be walked around in.\nAs Above, So below....\nAs Without, so Within....\nAs the Universe, So the Soul...\nxXx\n",
