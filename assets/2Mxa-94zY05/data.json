    "description": "It's an extraordinary metal only available in our island. It has extraordinary abilities to absorb, store, and release large amounts of kinetic energy. It was discovered by the founders of our city in 2000 while they were looking for water and food for their stay in the island, in those days desert, because of a  shipwreck.\nIts usage has been crucial for the development of the technology of our society, the large energy can be used for the development of devices as holograms or the high speed trains that nowadays are crossing our city from east to west.\n",
