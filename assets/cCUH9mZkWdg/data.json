    "description": "I was thrilled with the subject of COLOURFUL. I had been playing with crystals during my practice and decided to make a RAINBOW CRYSTAL TEMPLE with a flashing dance floor, hanging in space. There is a crystal altar in the centre to dance around. This is a BIG scale piece. I only used 7 chakra rainbow colours in this piece. I loved every second of this contest. \n#TiltBrushPaintOff2021",
