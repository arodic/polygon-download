    "description": "looking at the back at just right angle there is a guy wearing a gold mask. You can see the mask from the front as well. The front view has a horned owl holding the moon on his tail. It is tricky but the correct side view is a woman with her hair and arms stretched behind her, two legs at bottom and the blue and purple are supposed to be her dress. I make this piece for my friend and awesome roommate Kay.",
