    "description": "He is the guardian of the Yucca-Ginkgo Kingdom's space station. He became the guardian in the 70s, so he thinks that disco is still popular. He didn't know about Squirrel Boy, so Squirrel Boy came on the space station, and told Astro Guard that Yuccaline was shutting down the space station. So he decided to revolt. If you turn off his suit, you drain some oxygen from his oxygen tank. HE can breath in space, but in a space station, he uses air.",
