    "description": "I wanted to combat the rhetoric towards trans people specifically that rhetoric that contains words like \"unnatural\" and \"disgusting\", so I tried to make the bodies feel like a part of the landscape and seem beautiful. However it is worth noting that trans people are constantly being torn down, thus they no bodies are complete.",
