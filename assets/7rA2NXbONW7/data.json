    "description": "A space RPG campaign I ran one time was set on this tidal-locked world. One side always faces the star it orbits, and the other is a forever midnight frozen waste. The lump on the dark side is a huge pile of frozen hydrogen, captured by the magnetic field from the solar wind.\n\nI was thinking that there would be an advanced civilization of magma-dwelling creatures living in the volume of the planet, but the players never got far enough to interact with them.\n\nA few statistics:\nOrbital period: 5.32 earth days\nMean orbital radius: 9.14 Gm\nApparent solar size: 17.2 times earth\nPlanetary mass: 2.55E+023 Kg\nPlanetary mean radius: 2140 km\nSurface gravity: .38 gee\nMagnetic field size: 1.60E+008\tm\nField Density, Poles: 3.82E+002\tGauss\nHydrogen snow depth at pole: 80 km\nPressure at the bottom of the hydrogen ice-cap: 26.2 MPa\n\nLike this model, but need something a bit different?
