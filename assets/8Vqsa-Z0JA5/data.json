    "description": "Ashley Pinnick and I made a traditional painting setup of models from the Unity asset store, brought them into Tilt Brush like a traditional painting workshop.....  and tried painting them. Yay experiments!\n\nWe both had different thoughts of 2D or 3D, but similar approaches. This was hella experimental and hella fun. hahaha",
