    "description": "This is my first sketch, so please go easy on me... ðŸ˜…\nAnyways, I based this off of a book/play/musical called BE MORE CHILL. You should go watch it; I personally recommend the musical, but to each their own. If you DO decide to go watch it, type \"be more chill full animatic\" in the YouTube serchbar, then click on the one that's two hours and twelve minutes long. Have a good day~!",
