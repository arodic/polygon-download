    "description": "A 3D projection of the 120-cell, a 4D polytope that has 120 dodecahedral cells.  This is a \"hidden-cell removed\" projection, to avoid confusing clutter in the projection; we are seeing roughly half of the cells.\n\nIt is \"vertex-first\" because the center of the projection is a vertex, where four dodecahedra meet symmetrically.\n\nCreated with vZome (https://vzome.com)",
