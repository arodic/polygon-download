    "description": "I can churn these out all day, so this is going to be my last one for a while. \n\nAgain, these are transcoded from LEGO's Virtual Designer system. \n\nIt was quite a few steps to make it happen, but I think I've proven I have it down pat.\n\nI hope you've enjoyed these LEGO uploads. Let me know if there is one in particular you'd like to see.\n\nI'll make this one \"remixable,\" forever destroying any monetary value it may have. I think that'll sufficiently make my point.",
