    "description": "This is one of the largest Reef Balls, called Golieth Ball, with a special lifter ring that can be filled with rocks in the field to adjust the exact crest high of the Golieth Ball so that a submerged breakwater can be created with exacting height even when the bottom varies in depth.  It has been used successfully in the Turtle Islands in Malaysia then later around the world from Reef Innovations and Reef Ball Foundation",
