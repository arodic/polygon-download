    "description": "Best way to make a material blacker is to increase the Specular Exponent (Ns in the mtl file) M1-M6 demonstrate this.\n\nSpecular exponent goes from 0 to 1000, 0 being dull and 1000 being mirror-like\n\nOf course the object will become shinier as a result. \n\nIn blender this is known as Specular Hardness\n\nAlso, setting the ILLUM value to a mirror effect (3,5) will make the object dark too, keep in mind that there will be a different illumination effect because of the mirror effect. M7- M9 demonstrate this effect\n\nIn Blender, setting mirror and giving it a <0 value will achieve this as well",
