    "description": "My D&D Character Sutter Caine. She's a Profane Soul Bloodhunter. Who is all about fire. She takes damage and can light her sword on fire, so I RP that she cuts herself and her blood ignites on her sword. And she does a lot of fire magic. Personality she's somewhere between Wednesday Adams and Rosa from Brooklyn 9-9 so, a lot of fun to play. <3",
