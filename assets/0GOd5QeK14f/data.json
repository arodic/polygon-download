    "description": "This is my final version of my John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" piece. The lighting is still a little weird since the export process doesn't seem to take in scene lighting from tiltBrush. if you want to see what the lighting should look like, pop on over to my twitter page post. Close all other tabs in your internet browser, this is a heavy scene :D\n\nhttps://twitter.com/VRgoofball/status/970167099355160581",
