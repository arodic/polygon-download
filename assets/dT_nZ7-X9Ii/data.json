    "description": "I have uploaded this to other places online and it has been altered but this is the original (simplified) scan.  It is from a statue in our office that my father purchased long ago.\n\nScanned from a series of images via Autodesk 123D Catch application (discontinued). The original file was reduced in polygons with Sculptris before importing to Sketchup.  Exported from Sketchup to obj for uploading here.\n\nThe highest poly count and original mesh scan is long lost with a hard drive that failed and the online storage of a discontinued photogrammetry site.",
