    "name": "Fantasy Sword, Winged",
    "description": "The result of an early collaboration with Squiggs, AKA Daniel Papke, this winged sword was designed as part of a Skyrim mod-set. The spiral wooden handle with minimal leather binding always struck me as a bit janky, but hey it's fantasy! The wings turned out pretty good, and I really like the runes on the blade.\n\nLike this model, but need something a bit different? I take commissions! http://peripheralarbor.com/commission/",
