    "description": "This was made for a book project. There are three separate models in this, combined to one. The first is the mountain because it was the main meeting place and used to spot rescuers. The second is the crashed plane; it is how they ended up on the island. Third is the pig on top of the mountain; it was there first kill and symbolizes them growing up. The pig can be found by searching - \"Lord of the Flies Pig.\" Everything found in this is made by me in either Google Tilt Brush or Google Blocks.",
