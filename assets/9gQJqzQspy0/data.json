    "description": "The scene shows a \"Fua\", a historical working boat which is very common in the area of the inner Salzkammergut in Austria. The inspiration for this scene was an article which reports that in Hallstatt only one man remains with the expertness to build this historical boat in the way typical for Hallstatt.\n\narticle (German) http://bit.ly/2oB8XCU",
