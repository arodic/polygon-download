    "description": "The Fountain of Neptune in Bologna was completely designed, with the exception of Neptune himself (which was created by Gianbologna), by Tommaso Laureti. Painter, engineer and sculptor from Palermo, he designed and planned the whole structure of the fountain, from its external decorations to the tubes that even nowadays connect the fountain to the cistern on the hills, also designed by Laureti, called the Cistern of Valverde.",
