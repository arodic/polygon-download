    "description": "The sentence “impossible triangle” is just playing with words. The object you see on the video is a 3D computer model of an object wich can, and has many times, been build as a real object. It’s not disjointed and it’s obviously not a triangle… but a triangular shape. Several sculptures exist in the world, the first one has been done by the belgium artist who first created this 3D object from the 2D Penrose representation in the small town of Ophoven, Belgium. It was done in AutoCAD R14, then finished up in Inventor.",
