    "description": "this i depicting what a possible apartment would look like in the future. stackable, solar-powered, mini-cities that could be built into larger cities. the premise is you have moveable walls that go along a grided flor tile system, each wall and piece of furniture and appliance can be move effortlessly alongside the magnetic rail system within each apartment. they do not require much space as that's what the main room is for.  in the future I don't see us doing much else besides VR. there would be very little need for a job, or at least nearly no jobs would exist at all. we would live our lives virtually through programs, games, and experiences.
