    "description": "Earth, our home, is the third planet from the sun. It's the only planet known to have an atmosphere containing free oxygen, oceans of water on its surface and, of course, life.\n\nEarth is the fifth largest of the planets in the solar system. It's smaller than the four gas giants — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune — but larger than the three other rocky planets, Mercury, Mars and Venus.\n\nEarth has a diameter of roughly 8,000 miles (13,000 kilometers) and is round because gravity pulls matter in",
