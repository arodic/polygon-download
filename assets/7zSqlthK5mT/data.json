    "description": "Gods have many different names and many different forms, referred to as manifestations. Bhairava is the fierce manifestation of Shiva. He was especially important in Java, where worship of Bhairava was central to esoteric practices. Bhairava has fanged teeth and wears a serpent for a shawl.\n\nhttps://www.freersackler.si.edu/object/LTS2017.1.1/",
