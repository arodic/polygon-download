    "description": "This sculpture, created in Google Blocks with an Oculus Rift, uses the organic shape of a spider web and a simple color scheme to represent  WebXR environments. I've created this as part of a showcase for iLRN 2020. The spiderâ€™s web is an apt metaphor for virtual communities. It is a three-dimensional shape that is simple yet powerful, decentralized, and each one is unique. The threads are silver, representing modernity and that which is man-made, mechanical, and also technological. The purple dewdrops represent individual virtual environments and people. Purple is a color long associated with creativity, nobility, and spirituality, so it is particularly appropriate for representing our highest and best purposes.\n\n",
