    "description": "I can't remember what these are called, but I had one when I was a kid and it was a necessity for the many car rides I had to get my homework done. Basically it was a flat edge desk that would go in your lap with a cushion on the other side so it was comfy in your lap. Then when it got dark or you were just tired you could just flip it over and use it as a pillow.",
