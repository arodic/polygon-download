    "description": "I made this as I was researching the PSVR and Google Tilt Brush as a means to generate 3D adn VR content. It was a rather quick play around, and I started with the smoke brush applied to a spherical guide. Then I dropped that idea and just drew the arms of the galaxy spreading out from the center. Used a fw different shades of blue. really happy with this so far. Next I would love to have more finer details being applied to the smoke.",
