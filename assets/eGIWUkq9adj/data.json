    "description": "AerospaceNU, rocket subsystem, NASA ULSI 2020, Competition Rocketry\nThis system was used to separate the payload from its recovery parachute after landing. It features a linear actuator and eyehook. The system stays with the parachute, allowing the payload (a rover) to pull itself (and the eyehook) away. This is aided by two small constant force springs. Electrical connection is provided from the rover via pogo pins and a set of copper tape pads (rover-side). This model has been made transparent for viewing of its internal structure. The primary body material is 3D printed reinforced nylon.",
