    "description": "Loneliness, something we all fear but all feel with time.\nThe company that we long for but is never truly there for they are not there for themselves to begin with.\nSo are the people around us truly ever real ?\nWill they ever be ?\n\nThe ephemeral people, each face made up of a single line (one line drawing) to represent the short-lived relationships we encounter in our lives, some that mattered more than others, but fleeting nonetheless. They also represent the overwhelming feeling of absence of the presence of others whether they are really there or not. True isolation/loneliness or just our perception of it ?\n\nhttps://projectkubos.webflow.io/",
