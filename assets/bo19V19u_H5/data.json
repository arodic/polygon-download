    "description": "This is a part of series called Trading Places in which I create paintings, sculpts and animations in tribute to those VR artists who I'm inspired by. It's a great exercise in trying to fuse both of our voices together while still challenging myself to stretch. I channeled this wraith like figure when I started thinking of his latest sketch and gestural pieces, which have both an ancient and futuristic vibe. I've signed it with my chinese name and the character in the middle of the chest says \"heart\". Whatever you do, go follow Vlad's work asap. He's a keeper: https://twitter.com/vr_human?lang=en",
