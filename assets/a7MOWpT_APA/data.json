    "name": "Elsinct Crystal Chamber",
    "description": "This is a scene I made for a friend's RPG campaign. The idea is a giant magic crystal asteroid crashed and melted itself into the ground. Later it was harnessed for its magic properties, but over-used, and shattered. Still potent, the shards hang suspended in the cavern, emitting dangerous magic radiation. Now the fragments are being harvested by slaves.\n\nLots of little details here to enjoy.\n\nLike this model, but need something a bit different? I take commissions! http://peripheralarbor.com/commission/",
