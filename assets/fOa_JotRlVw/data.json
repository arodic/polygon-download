    "description": "\nScience Museum Group\nModel of human eye, 1870, by Dr. Auzoux, French.\n\nWithin this plaster model, each layer of the human eye can be revealed. The top plaster layer represents the sclera; at the front of the eye this becomes the cornea. The second layer, made from glass, shows the iris, pupil and surrounding area. The glass bulb represents the lens. The vitreous humour is behind the lens. The optic nerve is shown at the back of the model.\n\nRIGHTS: Data in the title, made, maker and details fields are released under Creative Commons Zero.
