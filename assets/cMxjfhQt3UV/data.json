    "description": "#galacticsafari\nThe Sentinel Army of The Empire Fsk.\nMilitant and merciless, any uninvited guests wandering foolishly into the barren waste of Tungath should expect to be met with extreme force by the Sentinel Army of The Empire Fsk. Armor plated and incredibly powerful, they have no need for weaponry. Numbered in the billions they mostly live below the surface of the planet in underground citadels but will quickly emerge en masse whenever their territory is violated. ",
