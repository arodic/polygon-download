    "description": "I started this movie study a few weeks ago and just wrapped it up! There is so much good dialogue in #queenandslim - the words she said in this scene just really resonated with me and I want to share that with you. Jodie Smith and Daniel Kaluuya gave such a moving performance in this movie. It's hard to walk away from it and look at the world and other people the same way.  I don't want to spoil it because I think it is absolutely worth your time to watch it.",
