    "description": "When disaster happens, Reef Ball teams must sometimes rescue coral and create a temporary coral nursery to protect the coral until it can be planted out via propagation onto Reef Balls.  This simple chicken wire and rebar framework can be deployed always landing upright in a sandy area of good water quality in the same depth the coral was rescued from and corals attached via zip ties and held for up to 90 days until full rescue can be accomplished.",
