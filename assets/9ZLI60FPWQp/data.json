    "description": "My function is to \"keep Summer safe\", not \"keep Summer being, like, totally stoked about, like, the general vibe, and stuff\". \nThat's you, that's how you talk. \n---\nTo celebrate the upcoming new season of Rick and Morty, I wanted to draw out my favorite scene via Tilt Brush.  \n\nSO EXCITED!!  \n\nI wish shape guides and the rescale feature was available when I first started on this.  I carefully twirled to make the circle of the ship.\n\n\nNow I hope Google can introduce layers in the near future... :P  \n\nReference:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0PuqSMB8uU\n",
