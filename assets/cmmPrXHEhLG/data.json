    "description": "Concept of the \"Grace\" in the 3rd dimension -from Terry Goodkind's series of books, The Sword of Truth.\n\nThe original picture you can find here: http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/sot/images/c/c0/Grace2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100323011505\n\nFrom the text, \"Though a Grace appears simple, it represents the whole of everything. The outer circle represents the beginning of the underworld -the infinite world of the dead. Out beyond the circle, the underworld, there is nothing else; there is only forever. The square represents the Veil, separating the world of the dead, from the world of the living (the inner circle). The star at the center of it all is the light -the Creator, with rays of His gift of magic coming from the light to pass through all the boundaries... \n\nThe Grace is the depiction of the continuum of the Gift.\"",
