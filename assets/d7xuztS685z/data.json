    "description": "A Dog-Bone Sample (DBS) is a cylindrical (or flat) specimen with a reduced section in the\ncentral area, where the rupture is independent of contact conditions.\nIt is a testing geometry for the characterisation of materials in mechanics.\n\nNOTE: The 3D model was created in SOLIDWORKS (edition 2014) with a .sldprt extension. The model was converted into a .slt then into a .obj file. The transition file (.slt) explains the triangular aspect (top of the specimen) for the discretisation. ",
