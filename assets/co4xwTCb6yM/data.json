    "description": "My first attempt at creating a character in GoogleVRâ€™s Blocks tool - in this case, I wanted to create some kind of D&D style elemental. Something monstrous and powerful that could smash through enemies with ease.\n\nInspired obviously by a lot of fantasy literature, games, and movies. There are a few aspects of the model which I am not entirely happy with and would like to go back and revisit now that I am more familiar with the tool.\n\nTwitter: @alexrajohnson",
