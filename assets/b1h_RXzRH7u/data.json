    "description": "All water in the ground is groundwater. A layer of permeable rock containing water in between the rocks or in the pores within the rocks, we call this an aquifer. Aquifers have had significant importance to human history. Much of farmland USA is sitting atop quifers. Groundwater is an important source of water to mankind, and is often polluted as chemicals seep into the ground. When water moves through the ground, called percolation,  the water refills aquifers. Move the model around and experience percolation and the aquifer beneath the small pond. ",
