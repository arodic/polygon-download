    "description": "Here I've started drawing over the grey sketch lines with my final lines. Where it doesn't make sense to have a black line - the middle of the forehead, for example - I've filled out the silhouette with a grey wire brush.\n\nI'm keeping the mirror plane on for the moment, but later I'll delete certain lines on the face and add asymmetry.
