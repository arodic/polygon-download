    "description": "A collaborative project made by students and mentors at Studio NPL's flagship branch in downtown Nashville. Each student was introduced to the tools in Tilt Brush and then created their own coral or sponge based off of reference images provided by the mentors and then embedded their drawing in the reef. Each student had about 30 minutes to learn the tools and make their drawing, and about 10 students contributed to the reef. ",
