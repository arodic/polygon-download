    "description": "Autumn brings rainy days and gloomy weather so the bright colours of ocean faune and flora is what makes even dank days much better. \n\nGeographically Belarus don't have an access to the sea. But your imagination is what can take you anywhere, even to the ocean depth!\n\nFeel free to use this work in remix.",
