    "description": "The world was created because of a long dream I have had since I was a kid, to visit Japan. This year, Me and my sister are finally making that dream come true, and this is tribute to that trip. This work is based off a temple in japan, called the Inari Shrine. Inari is the goddess of tea and rice, and is one of the most famous temples in Japan. The tori gates, which are the red arches, leading up to the temple represent the important events that lead up to me being able to visit this beautiful country. The Sunrise represents a new experience and a new day. My companion is the foxes, which are known as Inariâ€™s messengers in japan. They are guiding me through the tori gates, which represent the necessary steps I need to take to be able to make this trip. The foxes represent friends and family who made this dream of mine possible. Also, there are spirits flying through the tori gates who are also taking a journey to the temple. These represent others who are working hard to reach their own personal goals. At the end of the journey, you see the giant temple, which represents my goal of going to Japan. Once you get there, you realize the long journey and hard work is worth it to be able to get where you want to go.",
