    "description": "-- This is s large file and make take a few moments to download -- \n\nZoom in and explore the organelles (the components) of a plant cell and discover what many of them do in this artistic interpretation of a plant cell, created using Tiltbrush. \n\nStart your tour in the nucleus (the large sphere)  and follow the signs or take  your own route. This immersive 3D model is designed to help science /  biology students use the power of spatial memory to learn the parts and functions of a plant cell. Please feel free to remix and add more details. ",
