    "description": "'Bob VRoss' Live VR Art Stream March 22.\nIn this sketch, I asked Twitch chat for their favorite colors, and painted each lotus flower dedicated to each viewer's favorite color.\nThe environment that the lotus flower grows in is right in the middle of murky muddy waters. However, the beautiful lotus flower rises and blooms from the mud completely dirt-free.\nMay we all grow and bloom no matter what our circumstances.\nEmbrace your inner lotus flower. :)\n\"Seeing the mud around the lotus is pessimism. Seeing a lotus in the mud is optimism.\"\n\"Trust in the light, grow through the dirt, believe in the new.\"",
