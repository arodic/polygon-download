    "description": "For years Jook has been building her own private ‘empire of doodles’. She uses a self-invented technique of automatic drawing to delve into the subconscious. By quickly drawing, barring any conscious thought, she’s giving as much room as possible to her imagination. A new and totally unique world arises. Her anthropomorphic and surreal scenes depict a plethora of creatures, spanning from cute and innocent-looking to downright bizarre and monster-like. She invites you to get inspired. Join Jook’s world! Jook was a finalist for the Lumen Art Price, frequently has art shows and partakes in exhibitons at home and abroad. \n",
