    "description": "A couple weeks ago I went to LACMA. There was a sign up for Alejandro Inarritu’s 360 short called ‘Carne y Arena’ about Mexican immigrants. I wasn’t able to see the film due to its crazy popularity, but I have questioned if there is going to be a moment in human history where museums will be filled not with physical pieces but with virtual reality experiences. Inspired by the thought I recreated a few pieces from current exhibition by Sarah Charlesworth in VR.\n\nFeel free to come inside any of 3 rooms and see the art works.",
