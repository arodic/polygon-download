    "name": "Fantasy Sword, thorn spikes",
    "description": "This sword of unknown design and origin is as stylish as it is impractical. Very spiky in a rose thorn sort of way. The inward-facing spikes on the pommel would make it terrible to use, and the pommel plates are so large that it would be really difficult to strike with as well.\n\nLike this model, but need something a bit different? I take commissions! http://peripheralarbor.com/commission/",
