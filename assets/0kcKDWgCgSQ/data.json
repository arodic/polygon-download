    "description": "This is my depiction of a weird memory from the fall of 2016 in North Alabama. I observed the event from a cliff overlook at my favorite hiking spot in the middle of  the night. I forgot about this for some time and do not remember if I was with someone or alone. Now, it feels fuzzy like a dream, but the details surrounding the strange lights themselves and how they moved still ring clear in my mind.",
