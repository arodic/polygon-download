    "description": "Scene I made to practice lots of different textures.  Went well, but my PC was struggling  by the end. TIP: Never make grass in Blocks! Other plants are OK though. (UPDATE: The awesome Blocks team have reached out, and they are working on performance improvements on complex scenes, so yay!) Also, I wish we could manually choose to save models locally while signed in. Although I might have just not figured that out. Anyway, see it rendered in a few days over at www.SidelineMediaBlog.Wordpress.com\n:)",
