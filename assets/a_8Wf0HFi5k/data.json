    "description": "This started out just playing with the waveform brush and making some shapes that looked interesting. The next day I took it into a slightly more representational direction, turning it into a sort of butterfly/dragonfly. Then I aded the flower and diamond/rock formations. My daughter loves both dragonflies and butterflies, so this if for her :)",
