    "description": "I made this for my boss, roll model, and friend. There are talking phish, and a hidden message in the flower. This is a special one of a kind just for her thing or I would gladly allow remixing. I do hope others find beauty in it as well. The creative brain and process is one of the greatest things we were given in life. It can help in problem solving, Substance use disorder, and mental health conditions. I created this piece in grate depression over grieving my mother as well as being isolated and sick ( its not covid-19) if you are in the future you might have to look that one up, ha. My mother may be gone but creating this made my realize who I do have in my like and just how special that is. \nupdate: remix away",
