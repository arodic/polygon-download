    "description": "Over the past year I've used Google Tiltbrush VR to create a homage to iconic Australian artist Sir Sidney Nolan and our cultural anti-hero Edward 'Ned' Kelly.  \n\nThe title for my project comes from Kelly's infamous (and rambling) Jerilderie Letter - https://www.nma.gov.au/explore/features/ned-kelly-jerilderie-letter\n\nAs soon as I started playing in VR I knew that I wanted to re-imagine some of Nolan's works. I started with 'Ned Kelly' (1946) as that is the one that we teachers often use to excite the pallete of young artists in primary school. As it stands, I've created 5 full pieces, which only leaves me around another 200 or so in the sequence left to go...gulp!\n\nThe Sidney Nolan Foundation have seen my work on Twitter and have liked it, so that's a good thing! If Nolan was still alive, I reckon that he'd have been an early adopter of VR.\n\nHope you enjoy!\nCheers, \nJim\nwww.artofjimbo.com\n",
