    "description": "One of the most colourful things I saw this week was the volcano happening in Iceland. So at first I decided to sculpt that but the fantasy part of me took over and instead my sculpt turned into a floating crystalline inflused island embodying the Machine of nature...\n\nThe sculpt is fully 360, can be veiwed from any angle. I chose to use just one type of brush and stick with it to help me focus and so the style would look consistent. \n\n#TiltBrushPaintOff2021",
