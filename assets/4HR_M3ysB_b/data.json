    "description": "This is a 6 cyl engine design, and is free for use in whatever you want. Public domain and all that. Just don't claim it as your own. That'd be mean.\n\nBut yeah, it's got a long stroke, so not high revving. Ideal for stationary applications. Just the block. No, I didn't make other parts and I don't know the displacement.",
