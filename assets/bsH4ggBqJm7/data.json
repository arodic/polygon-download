    "description": " A raspado is an ice-based dessert made of fine shavings or finely crushed ice. Raspar is Spanish for \"scrape\"; hence raspado means \"scraped\", referring to the ice. Raspados come in a wide range of fruit flavors and classic Mexican flavors, including leche (sweetened milk with cinnamon), picosito (lemon and chili powder), chamoy (fruits and chili sauce, known as chamoyada), cucumber, guanabana, guava, pistachio, and tamarind.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, this shave iced deliciousness is called a piragua! [piˈɾa.ɣwa]! Piraguas are sold by vendors, known as piragüeros, from small colorful pushcarts.\n\nIn Costa Rica, it's named Copo, which in Spanish means “flake”! \n\nArt created by TecnoLatinx VR Artist: Steve Vazquez\n\nTecnoLatinxVR FB Page: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/TecnoLatinxVR/\n\nSteve's VR Artist page: https://www.facebook.com/vaas.kuez/",
