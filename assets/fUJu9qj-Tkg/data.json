    "description": "It has a gridal system of organization. The model shows the transformation of planar elements into a solid object but it does not directly becomes a cubic form. Rather than that it reflexes the idea of a formation of cubic form. The colors are chosen to highlight the idea that for transformation, there should be something that is being added or distracted . Thus yellow turned into white by adding white and turned into red by adding red. From every perspective only one hue is seen and it forms a big square. ",
