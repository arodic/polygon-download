    "description": "Early mockup of the interior of the Bad Juju Mutant Vehicle. The exterior can be found in other published models, this design focuses soley on the interior space.\n\nBad Juju is the corpse of an enormous alligator, reanimated to serve as the eyes and ears of an ancient Kami of the swamp.\n\nThe waterlogged roots of an ancient cypress twist through her limbs and spine, the nerves of the swamp that she carries with her.\n\nThe swamp lounge is designed to be a dark and unsettling place to hitch a ride in, peaceful if you can embrace the vibrant and dark side of nature.",
