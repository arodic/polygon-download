    "description": "On a crisp fall morning in Chicago, surrounded by dozens of friends and family, I was wheeled into an operating room to receive the gift of life, generously donated by a family grieving the loss of a loved one. Their death in my place so I could continue life. It was 1991 and I was 14 years old. A gift I cherish to this day. This is an image that came to me early after that experience that I've returned to to time and again as I remember the love and generosity displayed to me.",
