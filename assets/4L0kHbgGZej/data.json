    "name": "Myself, Sitting in a Chair",
    "description": "I got this cool idea to start \"scan\" drawing my white chair. It turned out pretty good, and it was really fun to sit in something virtual, which is also real. Then I thought, \"What if I scan myself, sitting in that chair!?\" So I got to work, scanning my legs, arms, and torso. I can't scan my own head (Interesting limitation of a Windows Mixed Reality Headset, lol. Puts into Oculus Rift review \"I can paint my own head in Tilt Brush!\"), but I was able to get most of myself. And that's also why I only have the front part scanned, and I'm missing my neck and chest area.",
