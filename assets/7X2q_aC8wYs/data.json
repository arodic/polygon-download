    "description": "this is a rendition of the album cover that Paris Jackson recently released. The song is called Wilted. She made a call to artist to create work that is inspired by the cover, art and the song.\n\nThis is my submission. Hopefully she enjoys this CDK original and hopefully you do too. The artist She selects will have their work as the cover animation on Spotify, which will be distributed by her and her team.\n\nHer music is ominous and beautiful. I highly recommend listening. ",
