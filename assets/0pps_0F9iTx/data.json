    "description": "Et voila! \nHere is my next Tilt Brush Scene! \nThis time I combined all the knowledge from Danny Bittman‚Äôs tutorials and managed to create this scenery of Journey and Sky in one. The most difficult part was by far the scaling at the beginning and to model the objects proportionally to each other. I switched to the home position over and over again and worked a lot with perspective lines. I think it turned out very pretty :)\n\nIn the next few days I will cut a video of the scene again and upload it to YouTube! Stay tuned! üíõ\n\n#thatgamecompany #journey #sky #desert",
