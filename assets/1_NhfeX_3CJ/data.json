    "description": "Just a simple proportionate human posing doll. It's a little weird to use but it will surely help you get a better grasp of where you need to be drawing in this 3D space! Have fun!\n\n- To use this guide use the select tool and select the bone you would like to move. \n\n- Suggested limb movement: Select all 3 limb bones at once and pose from the torso out.\n\n- Each limb can be moved at the connecting joint to the torso, knee/elbow, and wrist/ankle.\n\n- The head can also be moved and connects to the torso at the bottom of the neck.\n\n",
