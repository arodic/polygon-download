    "description": "i never got a chance to eat at one of these because I was too shy to talk to the vendor - I didn't think my Japanese was good enough.They would set up yatais or these little Japanese food carts up in the city around 5pm- I loved seeing the ones next to the rivers and canals when I stayed in Fukuoka. \n \nI heard that they were slowly dying out (not sure if this is true) so this is my way of trying to capture what that experience would have been like. \n\ni wanted to put more details but I was reaching the memory limit-- so hopefully I can do a drawover of the scene I wanted to create.",
