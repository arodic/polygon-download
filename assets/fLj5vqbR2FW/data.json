    "name": "Dr. Beetle's lab",
    "description": "Based off of the \"Girl Genius\" comic by Phil Foglio.\nThis work was not approved by, sponsored by, or affiliated with Studio Foglio LLC or Airship Entertainment.\nPlease visit: http://girlgeniusonline.com/\n\nI modeled the interior of the lab based on comics starting here:\nhttp://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20021206\nVery little license has been taken with the scene. Some parts of the Dihoxulator are never seen in the comic (and probably never will be) so I fleshed it out as best I could. Very rewarding to work from such a technically excellent source. Phil Foglio maintains consistency between vastly differing views, which made it much easier to model the lab. I hope you enjoy it, and take a look at the comic!\n\nLike this model, but need something a bit different? I take commissions! http://peripheralarbor.com/commission/",
