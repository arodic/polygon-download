    "description": "In this piece,   I stacked 10 pieces of oversized tablewares, tilted at precarious angles as a column. The column represents a culture and aesthetic in ancient Rome with no structural significance. However, in Chinese, Colum is a pronoun of the man of the house, spirit support for peopleâ€™s minds. I want to build my own column to support my inner self. I intend to use marble and fiberglass as materials. The mix of the classic sculptural material and modern manufacturing material will be an interesting combination. The color of this column is pure and simple, ivory white with an antique finish.",
