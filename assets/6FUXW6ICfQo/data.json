    "name": "The Creatubbles",
    "description": "The show takes place in a grassy, floral landscape populated by rabbits with bird calls audible in the background. The main shelter of the three creatubbles is an earth house known as the \"Animatronic Superhome\" implanted in the ground and accessed through a hole at the top or an especially large semicircular door at the dome's foot. The creatubbles co-exist with a number of strange contraptions such as the Noo-noo, the group's anthropomorphic blue vacuum cleaner, and the Voice Trumpets. The show's colourful, psychedelic setting was designed specifically to appeal to the attention spans of infants and unlock different sections of the mind while also educating young children of transitions that can be expected in life.\n\nAn assortment of rituals are performed throughout the course of every episode, such as the playful interactions between the Teletubbies and the Voice Trumpets, mishaps caused by the Noo-noo, the footage of children displayed on the screens, and the magical event that occurs once per episode. The event differs each time; it is often caused inexplicably and is frequently strange yet whimsical. Each episode is closed by the Voice Trumpets and the narrator. The disappointed, reluctant, but eventually obedient creatubbles bid farewell to the viewer as they go back to the Super Home while the Sun Baby sets.",
