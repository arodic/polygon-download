    "description": "As we bear witness to the willful extinction of endangered species across the planet at our hands, I always come back to how we as a human species exact this kind of violence to each other. This senseless culling and displacement across every  tribal line imaginable. And I can only be heartened by the fact that it's the next generation that will be ready and motivated to fight this tide. This tide that threatens to swallow what's still good about us.",
