    "description": "This is a tribute to a young woman who passed away during a week I spent in a Southeast Asian CCU. There was much suffering in that room day to day, but something about this comatose, anonymous soul really broke my heart. This was painted in the hopes that she found some light in the end. That in the intersection of the corporeal and ethereal, there was some peace for her and all those who pass.",
