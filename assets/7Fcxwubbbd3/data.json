A hall of mirrors could help here, as getting the right shape from every angle is a no go. Otherwise a smoothing tool might work, as the main issue is lining up the additions to avoid weird lighting.\n\nIt's definitely a lot easier to make things now, so I'm looking forward to getting back into it.",
