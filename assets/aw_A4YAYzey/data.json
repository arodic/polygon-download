    "description": "Around three hours work to test out how far I could go with blocks.  He Definitely came out alright and since you can't go too tiny, I had to work with subtractions to colour things in.\n\nUnfortunately there's a lot of issues with stray polygons, but that's down to the lack of tools such as erasing divisions and turning off snapping. Two our of the three hours were spent fiddling with the joints because they simply kept messing up and going out of place.\n\nDefinitely seeing the amazing potential, it's just taking far too long to really draw big things like this constantly.",
